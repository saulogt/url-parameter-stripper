Removes specified substrings or query parameters from URLs before they’re stored (posts, pages, etc).
Particularly useful when a a text is generated by AI (like chatgpt) and is pasted in the editor. The plugin can remove those utm_ parameters that comes from the AI generated links.

== Description ==
URL Parameter Stripper keeps your database free from noisy tracking fragments. It sanitizes URLs whenever content is saved, ensuring analytics tags or partner references do not persist in posts, comments, or metadata. This leads to cleaner canonical links, leaner revisions, and less PII traveling through your site exports.

= Highlights =
- Strip tracking params like utm_* / gclid / fbclid (supports wildcards)
- Remove arbitrary substrings that you define (for example affiliate tokens)
- Applies to post content, excerpts, comments (including author URLs), profile URLs, and option/meta data passed through the sanitizer helper
- Tested on WordPress 6.8.3 with classic and block editors

= Configuration =
1. Navigate to **Settings → URL Stripper**.
2. Enter comma-separated patterns. Keys ending with `*` match any suffix (e.g., `utm_*`). Any other text will be removed wherever it appears inside URLs.
3. Save changes; the rules take effect immediately for future saves.

Patterns are stored as plain text. Site exports/imports retain them, making migrations predictable.

== Installation ==
1. Upload to `/wp-content/plugins/url-parameter-stripper`
2. Activate the plugin
3. Go to **Settings → URL Stripper** to configure

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Does it modify existing content? =
Only on save/update. To retroactively sanitize, re-save content or run a small WP-CLI script.

= Will it break legitimate query parameters? =
Only the keys or substrings you list are removed. Leave required parameters (e.g., `page_id`) out of the field and they stay untouched.

= Does it change front-end links? =
Sanitization happens before content reaches the database. Front-end rendering simply uses the stored clean value.

= Is it safe for multisite? =
Yes. Each site holds its own pattern list in options, and the capability check ensures only administrators can edit it.

== Screenshots ==
1. Settings page showing the pattern input field and examples.
2. Example post showing a cleaned link.
